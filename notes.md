# Start with -

population = 100
grain = 3000
acres = 1000

# Randomize acreValue
# textarea that allows real commands, such as 'sell 100' to sell 100 acres at the market value, or 'feed 100' to feed 100 people

full list of example commands -

buy 100
sell 100
feed 100
next turn
plant 100

Really only need a textarea plus 'buy', 'sell', 'feed', 'plant', 'next' then evaluate the values.
